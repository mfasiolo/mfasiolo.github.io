I am a statistician working on Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) at the University of Bristol. Broadly, my research aims at developing new statistical methodology and software (mainly R packages) for tackling interesting scientific and industrial problems. The main application I am currently focusing on is electricity demand forecasting, and this part of my work is performed in collaboration with Électricité de France (EDF) R&D. My other research interests are intractable likelihoods and importance sampling. 

I am currently to supervising the work of the following PhD students:

   - Daniel Ward, sponsored by Improbable and co-supervised by Mark Beaumont, Patrick Cannon and Sebastian Schmon;
   - Euan Enticott, sponsored by EDF and co-supervised by Nick Whiteley and Yannig Goude;
   - Hui Yan, sponsored by EDF and co-supervised by Haeran Cho and Yannig Goude; 
   - Ben Griffiths, sponsored by EDF and co-supervised by Yannig Goude.

Beside doing research, I enjoy teaching short courses on GAM modelling, so if you are interested in organizing one don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:matteo.fasiolo@gmail.com).
