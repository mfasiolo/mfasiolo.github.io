# Theory of Inference MATH35600/MATHM0019

<br> 

The course instructor is [Matteo Fasiolo](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/people/matteo-fasiolo/overview.html) (Fry GA.17). There are 2 lectures (see below) and one computer lab-based tutorial (XXX - see BB page) each week. 20% of the course mark will be from an assessed practical project. The remaining 80% comes from a 2.5 hour exam consisting of 4 questions (no choice): an example is provided below. Tutorial sheet questions provide the best preparation for the exam. Office hours are XXX (see BB page).

#### Course material

The course will be based on the following material:

* [Lecture Notes](TOI/notes.pdf) These may be updated as the course progresses.
* [Matrix Notes](TOI/matrix.pdf) Essential revision notes on matrices.
* [Core Statistics](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~swood34/core-statistics.pdf) is a short textbook covering the material in this course, along with background and extensions. Chapter one should be reviewed for the essential background assumed by the course.
* [JAGs manual](TOI/jags_user_manual.pdf) JAGS user manual is a handy reference for when we cover Bayesian computation. 

Further relevant books are:

* D.R. Cox (2006) *Principles of Statistical Inference* also covers much of the material in the course. 
* A.C. Davison (2003) *Statistical Models* covers everything we cover and much more.
* G. Casella and R.L Berger (1990) *Statistical Inference* covers many of the topics in greater mathematical depth.
* Daniel Kahneman's *Thinking Fast and Slow* has alot of interesting things to say about statistical reasoning, and the built in flaws in how we humans tend to reason and make inferences. 

If you need to brush up on basic matrix algebra and multivariate calculus, you might want to have a look at:

* [Basic matrix algebra](http://www.sosmath.com/matrix/matrix.html)
* [Simple matrix differentiation](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Econometric_Theory/Matrix_Differentiation)
* [Simple explanation of multivariate Taylor expansion](https://mathinsight.org/taylors_theorem_multivariable_introduction)

These are some data sets that you might need during the course:

* [confound.txt](TOI/confound.txt)
* [urchin.vol.dat](TOI/urchin.vol.dat)
* [bccd.dat](TOI/bccd.dat)
* [sh-H1N1.dat](TOI/sh-H1N1.dat)
* [algae.dat](TOI/algae.dat)

You can load them in R using code such as:
```{r eval=FALSE}
dat <- read.table("https://mfasiolo.github.io/TOI/confound.txt")
```
