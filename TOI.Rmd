##### Course material

The course will be based on the following material:

* [Lecture Notes](TOI/notes.pdf) These may be updated as the course progresses.
* [Matrix Notes](TOI/matrix.pdf) Essential revision notes on matrices.
* [Core Statistics](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~swood34/core-statistics.pdf) is a short textbook covering the material in this course, along with background and extensions. Chapter one should be reviewed for the essential background assumed by the course.
* [JAGs manual](TOI/jags_user_manual.pdf) JAGS user manual is a handy reference for when we cover Bayesian computation.
