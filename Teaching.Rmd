#### Statistical Computing 2

Between 2020 and 2024, I taught the Statistical Computing 2 module of the [COMPASS CDT program](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/). The course, which was aimed at 1st year PhD students, explained how to interface R with C/C++ and introduces the Rcpp R package, as well as some of its extensions. The material is available [here](https://mfasiolo.github.io/sc2-2019/).

#### Theory of Inference

Between 2021 and 2023, I was teaching the Theory of Inference (TOI) module to third and fourth year maths students. The course content was quite broad, ranging from standard hypothesis testing to Gibbs sampling in JAGs. The course material can be found [here](TOI.html).
